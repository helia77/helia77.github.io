    As part of my Bachelor Thesis, I worked under supervision of [Dr. Soleymani](http://sharif.edu/~soleymani/) on **Graph Learning in Heterogenous Networks**.
    In this project, I have proposed and implemented a novel Autoencoder approach to efficiently solve the problem of 
    link prediction in networks with diversity in nodes.
